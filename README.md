quotefault sucks

also naming is hard.

oh, yeah, this thing lets you save quotes. like bash, but not bash. 
the model here is more in line with modern messaging apps, so multi-message quotes 
and data correlation is the goal here. it'll feel kinda like slack does, hopefully.  

Features (coming soon™):

- voting system ☑️
- real search
- not awful display
- easy to consume API (_infosys_ anyone?)
