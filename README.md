quotefault sucks

also naming is hard

`TODO`:

- [ ] fix build system
- [ ] extract hardcoded config stuff to config file
- [ ] swap out web framework
- [ ] get liquibase working

oh, yeah, this thing lets you save quotes. like bash, but not bash.

Features (coming soonâ„¢):

- voting system
- real search
- not awful display
- easy to consume API (_infosys_ anyone?)
