quotefault sucks

also naming is hard.

`TODO`:

- [ ] unfuck my custom exceptions
- [ ] extract hardcoded config stuff to config file
- [ ] keycloak support
  - allow this to be optional
- [ ] get liquibase working
- [ ] UsersService
- [ ] http/2 support
- [ ] TLS for security and http/2
- [ ] add containerize step for openshift
- [ ] infosys-consumable endpoints (i.e. w/o keycloak auth)
- [ ] get exception logging working properly
- [x] fix build system
- [x] swap out web framework

oh, yeah, this thing lets you save quotes. like bash, but not bash.

Features (coming soonâ„¢):

- voting system
- real search
- not awful display
- easy to consume API (_infosys_ anyone?)
